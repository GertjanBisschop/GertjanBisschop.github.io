Experienced software engineer and data scientist with a strong foundation in statistical genetics, offering expertise in developing and implementing data-driven solutions to problems in genomics. Proficient in applying
probabilistic approaches to complex (biological) problems, I specialize in crafting algorithms and data workflows that
optimize insights from large-scale datasets. Skilled in leveraging high performance computing services for efficient
data processing, my experience extends to designing and implementing scalable solutions for diverse research needs.
From task automation to advanced statistical modeling, I excel in devising innovative strategies to extract meaningful
insights from complex biological data.

I have contributed to and/or designed multiple open-source software tools:
