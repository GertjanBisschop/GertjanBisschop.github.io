I am an experienced software engineer and data scientist with a background in statistical genetics.
I am a huge advocate of open-source software as a way to promote knowledge-sharing and collaboration.
Making code openly available ensures a larger group of people can test and potentially improve what they
consider to be a valuable resource.

I have contributed to and/or designed multiple **open-source software tools**:
